#!/usr/bin/env python3
#-*- Coding: utf-8 -*-

"""
This is a Docstring! This first docstring allows the developer to describe the purpose of this code.
You can also use the docstring to describe any other details about the code as you desire. 
The docstring will not run as part of the code, and is just used to give perspective to the user or other developers

Above you will see hash (#) followed by a exclamation mark (!) followed by '/usr/bin/env python3'
This should be the very first piece of you code as it will tell the code what interpreter to use. 
In This case: 'python3'

After that you see another line with (#) followed by '-*- coding: UTF-8 -*-'
This will tell the interpreter what encoding the rest of the code is formated in. 
In This Case: 'UTF-8'
