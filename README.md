# Python Projects

### Small repository for Python projects in their infancy. This is a repository of Code or Scripts I have created that have been tested in my own environment. They are subject for updates and improvements as I continously learn better ways to complete objectives. None of the codes or scripts should be used in a production or enterprise environment without proper approval. Furthermore, testing should be continous to ensure proper coding practices, security, and usage is maintained.
