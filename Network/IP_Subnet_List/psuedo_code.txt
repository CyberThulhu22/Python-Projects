def netClass(ip): What class is ipaddr. return CIDR
def possSubs(CIDR): Create list of "Possible Subnets" with range(cidr, 33) -> send to list()
def compSubs(providedSubs, possibleSubs): Compare two lists to see if any possible exist in provided
	if possible exists in provided, add IP to subnet dicitionary
	elif possible doesnt exist, create new dictionary with {IP:[possible subs];}

# Main Code
for each ip in var1:
	netClass(ip) # Determines CIDR and returns to use in next function
	possSubs(CIDR) # Creates list of Possible Subnets
	compSubs(provided, possible) # Compares, and adds either IP to providedSubs Dict, or adds possibleSubs to IP dict (Should have two dictionaries by the end)

# Output: Should look something like this:

-- IPs and Subnets Discovered --
Subnet 1:
	IP 1
	IP 2
Subnet 2:
	IP 3
Subnet 3:
	IP 4
	IP 5

-- IPs Discovered and Possible Subnets --

IP 6:
	Poss Subnet 1	CIDR: /16
	Poss Subnet 2	CIDR: /19
IP 7:
	Poss Subnet 3	CIDR: /25
	Poss Subnet 4	CIDR: /27
